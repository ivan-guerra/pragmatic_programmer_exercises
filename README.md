# The Pragmatic Programmers: Exercises for Programmers

This repo contains Rust solutions to the coding exercises provided in [The
Pragmatic Programmers: Exercises for Programmers][1].

To run any single solution, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin e<N>
```

where `<N>` is the number of the exercise you want to run. Likewise, you can run
all unit tests via `cargo test` or execute a single exercise's unit tests via
`cargo test --bin e<N>`.
